    <h3> what are Porcupine Meatball</h3>
    <p>
        Porcupine meatballs are ground beef-rice balls cooked in tomato sauce. The meatballs, a staple during the Great
        Depression because of the few ingredients required to make them, get their name from their appearance to
        porcupines (the rice makes the balls appear prickly).
