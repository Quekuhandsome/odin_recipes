    <h1>Camp David spaghetti With Italian Sausage</h1>
    <p>
        From a Navy chef who served it to presidents at Camp David, MD. I have served it to my family
        many times, and it is certainly fit for a president! It is best with a garden salad and crusty garlic bread.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Italian sausage links</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package dry spaghetti</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Slice sausages lengthwise, leaving links attached along one side; lay flat in a large skillet. Cook over medium heat until browned and cooked through, 5 minutes, flipping once. Transfer to a plate; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef, onion, garlic, and olive oil to the same skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until onion is translucent and beef is browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain all but 2 tablespoons drippings from the skillet.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato sauce, tomatoes, oregano, salt, basil, bay leaf, and black pepper; simmer, uncovered, over low heat until flavors have blended, about 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Remove and discard bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Stir spaghetti into sauce.</li>
        <li>Divide spaghetti and sauce among individual oven-safe baking dishes or plates; top each with a cooked half sausage and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and begins to brown, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
